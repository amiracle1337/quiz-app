# quiz-app

Built a quiz game where you get to test your general knowledge and then see your score. 

The app works as following:
1. Start quiz
2. Pick the answer you think is right on each question
3. Correct the quiz
4. See your score
5. Play again with new random questions
   
## How to run this app on your local machine

1. Run npm start (npm install first, if you haven't installed it already)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Notes

This was my first application built with React, transitioning from building applications in general Javascript.
